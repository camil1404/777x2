      Even 25 years after the B777 was first unveiled, it is still a hard act
      for the Boeing design team to follow. When it was revealed to the world in
      June 1994 it was the first computer-designed airliner, the first
      fly-by-wire airliner, and as the aircraft proved itself in service, it has
      proved a commercial success, with more than 1,500 delivered to date. There
      is a lot of love for the triple-seven, from airlines, crew and passengers
      alike. The B777 had another interesting first, being the first Boeing
      cabin design to be created with significant input from airlines, and this
      is where the B777X cabin design story begins. However, airline customers
      put a little more pressure on the Boeing team this time round. Kent
      Craver, Boeing’s regional director of cabin experience and revenue
      analysis, recalls the airline feedback at the beginning of the project:
      “You had a great breakthrough with the Dreamliner cabin interior. You need
      to do it again with the B777X. The B777 cabin is good, the B787 is great,
      but the B777X needs to be even better.” The B777X cabin is wider, more
      attractive and more high tech – and dare we say ‘better’ – than its
      predecessor’s cabin, but the real benefit for airlines is its much wider
      scope for customization, which can be achieved simply and quickly, with
      the cabin serving as a blank canvas for airline customers to express their
      brand. “The 777 cabin is pretty tough to beat,” agrees PJ Wilcynski,
      payloads chief architect, senior technical fellow and 39-year veteran at
      Boeing. “But with the 777X, we have taken the architecture to the next
      level.”
